# Machine Learning
**Defination:** *Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.*

## Machine Learning 
*  **Supervised Learning:** Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from
 the input to the output.
   * **Classification:**  *A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Malignant” or “Benign”.*
   * **Regression:** *A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.*
*  **Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.
   * **Clustering:**  *A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing 
behavior.*
   * **Regression:** *An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to   to buy y*


 ## Data Preprocessing
* Data Preprocessing is  an importing step that needs to be done before implementing any machine learning model.
  * Importing the Libraries
  * Importing the datasets
  * Taking care of Missing data
  * Encoding categorical data
  * Splitting the data set into training set and test set
  * feature scaling

## Regression
* ### Simple Linear Regression:
* ### Multi
